Solution Overview
This solution leverages a cloud-based chatbot for airline policies, focusing on Azure and AWS services, with generative AI support to deliver dynamic and interactive responses to employee queries on policies. This design ensures scalability, reliability, and ease of access.

Key Components
Frontend (UI)

Technology: Angular, for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
Purpose: This interface allows employees to interact with the chatbot, view policy updates, and search for specific information.
Chatbot Framework and NLP

Azure Bot Service or Amazon Lex: This layer interprets employee queries using natural language processing (NLP), providing accurate understanding of user intent.
Integration with Policy Data: Connects to backend databases where airline policy information is stored.
Generative AI for Dynamic Responses

Azure OpenAI or Amazon Bedrock: Adds advanced generative AI capabilities for complex policy questions, allowing for more personalized and in-depth responses.
Purpose: To handle diverse employee queries by generating natural responses based on the underlying policy data, enhancing usability and satisfaction.
Backend Processing and Data Storage

Azure Functions or AWS Lambda: Handles specific requests, such as retrieving policy data, processing updates, and managing chatbot responses in real time.
Database Options:
Azure Cosmos DB or Amazon DynamoDB: Stores policy documents, FAQs, and other reference materials for quick retrieval.
Updates and Versioning: Ensure policy information is current, with version control for updates.
Authentication and Security

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Amazon Cognito: Ensures secure access to the chatbot and policy data, with role-based access for employees.
Data Encryption: Implement data protection standards to keep sensitive policy information secure.
Solution Benefits
Enhanced Access: Provides 24/7 access to airline policies and procedural information.
Reduced Support Overhead: Automates answers to frequent policy questions, reducing the workload on HR or support teams.
Scalability: Leverages cloud infrastructure to handle high query volumes.
Security: Robust identity management and data encryption ensure only authorized employees access sensitive data.
Implementation Flow
Employee Query via Angular UI → Chatbot Framework (Azure Bot Service/Amazon Lex)
Policy Retrieval → Generative AI (Azure OpenAI or Amazon Bedrock) for complex questions or Direct Database Query for simple FAQs
Backend Processing → Serverless Functions (Azure Functions/AWS Lambda) for database interaction and updates
Response to Employee via Chatbot, integrating dynamic responses and policy information
This framework offers a comprehensive and scalable solution for accessing airline policies, ensuring employees receive immediate and reliable information on-demand.
